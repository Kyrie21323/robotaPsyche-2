	You may be inspired by any of:
	- Your readings above
	- [This](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses) list
	- The [IM Research Guide](https://guides.nyu.edu/IM) prepared by 
	our librarian [Beth Russell](mailto:beth.russell@nyu.edu). 

  Your topic can be an article, a project, a book, an artist, an event, etc.

	Terminator)

  Email your topic to me, which I will put on our website.

	incentive to do chose early. I will list topics that students have already
	chosen [here](studentPresentations.md)

	- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIz2L4tn5kM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YHt0dtyf4uiw8tKOxQLvlW)

Production Assignment:

- Make a car (or rocket) you can drive around with the arrows that points to
	which way you are going. Use the Mover class. There is no Attractor in this
	exercise. The left and right arrows make the mover move faster in that
	direction. You can use this code to detect the arrow keys:

````
void draw() {
}

// Register an interest in keyboard events
// by creating a keyPressed() function
void keyPressed() {
  if (key == CODED) {
    if (keyCode == LEFT) {
      println("you pressed the left arrow");

      // do something to make the mover move faster to the left
    }
  }
}
````
